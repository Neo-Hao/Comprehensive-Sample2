			<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>

			<p>In this project, you are going to implement the word guessing game, Hangman 2.0. Your program is going to get a random word from a website (instructions below) and then let the user guess letters until they get the word correct or they run out of guesses. A unique characteristic of Hangman 2.0 is that the user must specify a subset of the available spaces to check. So, for each guess, the user provides the letter to guess along with the spaces he/she wants to check.</p>

			<p><strong>The game has three levels of difficulty.</strong> The difficulty level determines the number of spaces allowed to check on each guess along with the total number of guesses the user can make. At the easy difficulty level, the user is allowed 15 guesses and must specify 4 spaces to check per guess. Users playing at the intermediate difficulty level get 12 guesses and must specify 3 spaces. When the game is on the hard difficulty level, the user gets 10 guesses and must specify 2 spaces at a time. An incorrect guess causes the program to decrement the number of remaining guesses, but a correct guess does not affect the number of remaining guesses. Also, invalid input does not affect the number of remaining guesses.</p>

			<p>Write a Java program in a file called <strong>Hangman2.java</strong> that allows the user to play Hangman as many times as they wish as long as the user doesn’t exceed 25 games (the maximum number of games the user can play). When the program begins, it will ask for the difficulty level from the user. The program should read the user’s input as a String, take the first letter from the string, and make sure that it is equal to ‘e’, ‘i’, or ‘h’. If the input is invalid, then a message is printed, and the user is re-prompted until the input is valid. The program then asks the user for their guess. After the game ends, the program will print the result and ask the user if they want to play again. Many other scenarios are given in the examples below. Your program should behave the same way for all test cases given. You should also come up with additional test cases in order to thoroughly test your application.</p>

			<h3>Requirements</h3>

			<p>You cannot use arrays or the StringBuilder class to implement this project. You can only work with the String methods discussed in lecture.</p>

			<p>You must use index 0 as the index of the first character in your word. For example, if the secret word is “gorilla”, the letter ‘g’ is at index 0. So, if the user specifies space 0, you should uncover the ‘g’. Failure to use correct indexing will have a negative impact on your assignment grade.</p>

			<p>In order to facilitate the testing of your program, you must include a boolean variable called testingMode initialized to true in the top of your class (under the class declaration and above your main method) as shown below.</p>

			<p class="code"><code>private static final boolean testingMode = true;</code></p>

			<p>If the value of the variable testingMode is true, your program will display the secret word the user should guess. This helps you test your program and helps us grade your program. Without this variable, we will not know what the correct answer is. See example 1 to see the output. On the other hand, if the value of the variable testingMode is set to false, the program will not show the value of the secret word. When you submit your code, make sure the variable is set to true.</p>

			<p>Use the RandomWord.newWord() method to generate random words, and this method should only be called once per game, and it can be called at most 25 times in a single program run (note: after 25 calls, it issues an error message and terminates). This method is provided to you. However, you must download the RandomWord.java file from the labs and projects website, and place RandomWord.java in the same source directory as Hangman2.java. RandomWord.java contains a single method that connects to a web site and downloads a random word. If you are interested in how it works, you can look at the source code. Do not modify the source code in RandomWord.java.</p>
